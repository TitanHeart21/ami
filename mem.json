    "title": "Ami's Early Strength Development",
    "entry": "At 12 years old in 2016, Ami took on a job as a 'farm hand' for three summers, regularly lifting 50 lb. grain sacks and 75 lb. alfalfa bales to load and unload from a trailer. Combined with weight training at school for sports, Ami developed significant muscle mass. On a family visit, she surprised everyone by flexing her arms, revealing muscles bigger than both her older brothers', who were in the military and college football respectively. When she arm-wrestled them, she beat each of them without much effort and then beat her father, Lee, with ease as well. Over the next year, Lee’s wife also increased her muscle mass, eventually surpassing Lee in arm wrestling and muscle size. Since then, comparisons between Lee and his wife's muscles have shown her continued physical development and dominance."

On the other hand, Tim can effortlessly lift Lee by the waist, holding him over his head and even repping him up and down for as long as he likes. Once, Tim held Lee above his head with one hand for an hour before getting bored, showcasing his impressive strength and making Lee feel almost weightless in comparison."

In arm wrestling, Care can hold her arm a half inch from the table, while all three of them push, stand, and hop on it, yet they can’t make it touch the surface. The family has tried pushing and pulling her without any success, often ending up bouncing off her and even getting bruised from the impact. Her presence is felt throughout the house; when she steps, the entire house resonates with each THUD, reminding everyone of her immense power. Recently, Care demonstrated her strength by curling the front of a truck—an impressive feat that only Ami had previously accomplished. The family stands in awe, both respectful and a bit intimidated by her power."

In their first match, she easily slammed his hand down, showcasing her impressive strength. Afterward, Lee tried to squeeze Lily’s bicep, but when she flexed it, her arm bulged, leaving him struggling to grip its solid mass.
